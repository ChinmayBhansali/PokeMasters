# PokéMasters

## The Unreal World of Pokémon

For this project, I plan on building a small version of the game I intend to fully develop after this term.
I made the original (physical) version of this game in grade 9 when I was in a boarding school and electronic devices were prohibited in the hostel.
That is when this idea of notebook based Pokémon game struck into my mind.
I played this game with my dorm mates a lot.
I have the full version of this game at home but in a notebook.
I plan on converting that physical game into a computer game and this project can help me initiate it.
It is originally a multiplayer  (hence the name PokéMaster***s***) offline game. But, for this project, I am only making a single-player game.

This is a role playing game (RPG for short) especially for Pokémon fans (and also for anyone who is interested in games), where you thrive to become the **PokéMaster**, by exploring the Pokémon universe, and bonding with Pokémon.
The more you spend time with your Pokémon and the more you fight alongside them, the more they bond with you and the faster they (and *you* too) grow.
You can walk on the map, find new Pokémon, fight with them, catch them, visit the *PokéCenter*, etc.
Although you can only take 6 Pokémon in a battle with you, you can have as many Pokémon in storage as you want.

But since this is not the full version of the game, there are limitations to what you can do in this game.
For example, your gameplay is limited to a certain number of Pokémon, you will not have any extra storage after your 6 Pokémon, etc.
Also, you will be able to save and reload your gameplay, or create new ones.

We hope you enjoy this game!
