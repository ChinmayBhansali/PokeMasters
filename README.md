## PokéMasters: The Unreal World of Pokémon

This is a role playing game (RPG for short) where you thrive to become the greatest Pokémon Trainer in the world by exploring the Pokémon universe and bonding with Pokémon and other Pokémon Trainers.
There is no limit to how many Pokémon you want to bond with. However, there is a certain number of Pokémon you can always carry with you in their *Pokéballs*.
In this game, you can have, at most, 6 Pokémon at a certain time with you. The more you spend time with your Pokémon and the more you fight alongside them, the more they bond with you and the faster they (and *you* too) grow.
You can walk on the map, find new Pokémon, fight with them, catch them, visit the PokéCenter, interact with other Pokémon Trainers, and fight the so-called Pokémon Gyms and win all the badges required to enter the infamous Pokémon Tournament of that region.

But since this is only a demo product, there are limitations to what you can do in this game.
For example, we have limited your gameplay to a certain number of Pokémon, and you won't be able to purchase any item from the PokéCenters.
If possible, we would give you a nice map depending upon how much we can build this demo game in the limited time we are provided with.
Also, you will be able to save and reload your gameplay, and also create new ones or delete previous ones.

We hope you enjoy this game!
